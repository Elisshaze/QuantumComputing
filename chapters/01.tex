\chapter{Introduction: from classical to quantum}
\section{Classical computing}
We'll start our discussion about quantum computing by first reviewing fundamental classical computers' notions.
\subsection{Bits and logical gates}
Classical computers are made by 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Elementary units: \textbf{bits}, that can take values $0,1$;
	\item Ellementary operations carried out by \textbf{logical gates}.
\end{itemize}
